# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in agent-scope, please report it responsibly by emailing the maintainers instead of using the public issue tracker.

**Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work with you to understand and address the issue.

## Security Considerations

### Dependencies

We regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. Run `npm audit` to check for known issues in your installation.

### Code Review

All code changes are reviewed before merging to ensure security best practices are followed.

### Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with security researchers to address issues before public disclosure.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed and fixed. Critical vulnerabilities may warrant immediate releases.
