## Context Initialization

Before starting the review process, clear any previous context:

- [ ] Reset mental state - start fresh analysis
- [ ] Forget previous review sessions
- [ ] Clear any cached assumptions about the code
- [ ] Focus only on current changes in this workflow execution

This ensures objective, unbiased code review without influence from prior context.
